over the last year, a fluid and instable group of people has been putting lots of thoughts and love in how to 
organize a small festival with an ambitious name that takes place at the institute of applied theatre studies 
in gießen since 1984. the question that was dealt with from lots of perspectives and that glued everything together
again and again was how to organize a festival, that doesn’t reproduce what it criticizes within its own microstructures
yet aims to refer to its prospective contents, becoming inherent.

DISKURS 2018 is an invitation to shift ideas of what could be an ‘us’, without a ‘them’.

facing the first autumn breezes, we* want to get together with you* to generate a collective presence of everything
we wish for. in a warming up conversation about warming up, we  share strategies for tough days and then read ourselves 
in the form of a novella. we watch sunrises together and practice ways of solidarity instead of affirming the very same
structures we* are not willing to put up with. for all of this and every possible more, we* offer time, space, proposals 
to be share and filled, or to be left empty, to waste, to sip and to compost.
